# Unity Rush00

An Intra project which involves remaking the equivalent of the top down shooter 
### "Hotline Miami"
in the space of 48 hours using C# and Unity.

While at the same time, we were not allowed to use any assets or scripts from the Unity Asset store,
and effectively making the entire game from scratch (save for any 2D assets and sounds given as resources)

The Rushes are done in groups of two, this one was done by 
#### Tamara Radloff and Gareth Lategan


##### this project will be touched up and improved over time, however to preserve the original, it will be in another Repository
